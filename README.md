### Notes üóíÔ∏è

- The E-Market Buyers application does not have payment gateway integration. This decision is based on the understanding that most UMKM businesses in Kecamatan Malingping do not have the resources to support online payment transactions. Instead, the application allows buyers to place orders and arrange payment and delivery details directly with the sellers.

- ##### All the technologies that are used in this project using the paid version. So, if you want to try this app, you need to create your own project in Firebase and Google Cloud Platform and replace the API keys with your own API keys
